## Secret level revealed!



We just received a message from a self-proclaimed "The pipe overlord" which might be of interest to you:

```
Esteemed Birdie Warriors,

You have soared through six formidable stages of my Pipe Towerâ€”an accomplishment worthy of recognition. But do not grow complacent! I now unleash my swiftest and most cunning lieutenants to test your resolve at level 7.

Should your median score reach 5 or higher, you shall earn 3 bonus marks as tribute to your skill.

But hear this: I remain unconvinced that any of you can attain a median score of 10 or more. Should one dare and succeed, an extra 2 bonus marks shall be granted.

P.S. the game_length is set to 50 for level 7.

With ever-watchful eyes,
The Pipe Overlord

Sovereign Sentinel of the Sky-Gates
Breaker of Birds | Guardian of the Green Pillars
Warden of the Endless Gap | High Architect of Aerial Agony
Eternal Ruler of the Vertical Labyrinths

Chamber of Obstacle Affairs
Level 8, Tower of Pipes

"Your fall is not personal. It is policy."
